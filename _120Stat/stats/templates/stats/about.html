        <h1>What is 120stat?</h1>
            <p>
                120stat is a website designed to help fantasy football players make informed decisions before drafting, 
                trading, or claiming players. The application utilizes <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/nfldb">nfldb</a>, 
                an open source project that provides a database and Python interface to gather NFL statistics. Our project 
                is currently a work in progress. It can be found at <a href="https://github.com/tsitsop/SD-D">nfldb</a>.
